# Huntress 2024 CTF write ups

A lot of the solves involve using [Binary Refinery](https://github.com/binref/refinery) - check it out!

Big thanks to [@alphillips-lab](https://github.com/alphillips-lab) for showing us refinery and his support with its usage.

If you want all Python scripts to "just work", install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
