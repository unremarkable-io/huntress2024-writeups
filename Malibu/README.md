# Malibu

First I asked ChatGPT what should I bring to the beach, using this wordlist we brute-forced the name of the bucket as
`bucket` (lol).

Using a Python [`minio`](https://pypi.org/project/minio/) library we connected to the backend and found a flag in one of
the files.

See [`malibu.py`](malibu.py) for code.
